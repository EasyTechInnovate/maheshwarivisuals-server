There is something called 
Month management feature which admin will have access 

There are 4 type but for now 3 we can ekeep in enums how we used in this project 

1. Analytics month management
2. Royalty month management
3. Bounus month management
4. MCN month management

we can create month for each type 
example 

month: Jan-25
display name: Jan-25
Display status : true or false
type: Analytics or Royalty or Bounus or MCN

admin can create this and then admin willl upload csv to each month of each type we can do that later this month management _id will be ref to the report modal
